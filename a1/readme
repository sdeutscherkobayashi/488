Since I worked alone, I did everything.

Each of the five files contains some toy programs of a certain type, 

A1a - arithmetic and comparison operations
A1b - array operations
A1c - iteration
A1d - non recursive functions and procedures
A1e - recursive functions and procedures

There is some overlap in the files. For example the arithmetic operations in A1a are contains in functions and
seen again in A1d. For more details see comments in individual files.
